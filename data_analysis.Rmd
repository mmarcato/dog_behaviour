```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(DescTools)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

## Importing Data


```{r cars}
setwd("E://Study//Ethogram")
data <- read.csv('20-02-26_Ethogram.csv')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
