Second attempt she lay down immediately where we left her for the duration as it was time for her to do the next section. Officially 3 attempts though as she wasn't asked to lay down. ,,4,3,,Wasnt asked to lie down so didnt respond to command but stayed in the down position when asked to stay and didnt break it. ,,4,4,No,No,,"Although her tail was slightly lowered, she was otherwise fine and didn't stir. She jumped up as soon as she clicked that I was asking it of her and she stood still. She wagged her tail at the end so I feel she was happy with me checking her. ",,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,,"Second response - tried to drop fore-body posture to remove tea-towel (as this was successful in the first response). She didnt realise that it had fallen off and then tried to remove it with her mouth, albeit that it had already fallen off - then realised that it was off and returned to normal state. ",,6,3,4,5,5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2,,2,,"I have marked Diva as indifferent because this would probably be the closest option available to her response. Though Diva wasnt completely indifferent - she didnt show any apprehension or fear, nor did she even approach let alone show high activity. She merely noticed, wagged her tail and moved on without pause. ",,4,"Diva was well behaved during this exercise with only one hind-quarter shuffle. But from her fixation on the kong, and un-diverted attention (apart from one gaze away) she was clearly very interested in it. ",,None,3,1,1,,,When she retrieved the kong she merely pushed it around with her nose. ,,5,1,,"While Diva showed interest on initially seeing the dog, she quickly lost interest and decided to rather investigate her surroundings thereafter. ",,4,1,3,4,1,,,4,3,5,,No,,Diva spent most of the time showing stress toward the crate - she began whining almost immediately (and I am sure that this would be her whines rather than the other dog as per the timing of it) and constantly pacing and even barking at times. She lay down at the very end when she gave up sniffing but she was definitely not settled. ,,1,2,3,,2,,,3,2,2,3,1,No,,,4,"I would say she was quite activated and enthused by my reunion even if she didn't stay by my side. Her demeanor changed from distress to happiness and a wagging tail. However, she did tend to pace a little and then come back again. ",,4,,,,,,,,,,,

However, tail began wagging and was a lot happier to be back on lead rather than let off on his own - demeanor improved",,2,1,1,3,"Dog very obsessed with handler, when he comes over his initial sniffing and excitement at the environment, he locks attention is drawn to handler support. Even at one time trying to mouth at handlers hand and get attention and play. I would say this is probably a coping mechanism at being unsure over his environment",,3,"Standing Response:
First response he stepped off the platform - handler corrected the position. Thereafter a good and uninterrupted response. ",,4,Did sitting response first - when handler brought him onto the platform he immediately assume seated position so the assessors allowed him to first show this response. The sit was not asked so the response was not necessarily as was requested but Earl did keep his position and not move for the duration of the sit,,3,4,,Handler did struggle to get the dog into the down position but once in the position the response was excellent. I have scored good as per the difficulty in trying to get the dog into the position initially. The response thereafter was excellent. ,,1,3,No,No,,"Early refused to get onto the table, not even wanted to put his fore-paws up and even after food lure and after handler climbs onto table herself in order to encourage.

Immediate change in posture - tail and ears lowered, back posture heightened and turned head toward handler and away from assessor holding him ",,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,,He seemed indifferent but from his body language he was more shutting down with the tea towel rather than being indifferent and hence I have stated indifferent and also change from neutral. Tail stopped wagging and becomes quite inhibited,,1,2,4,1,3,2.0,2.0,3.0,1,,2,,,,2,"Kept seated, didnt shuffle, looks away for a time, and though he seems fixated I think he is more waiting on handler to make next move rather than having and very high interest over the kong",,Left,3,1,1,,,Difficult to denote lateralisation with surety. However from the left tilt as he lay down and his head facing toward his left I would say he favoured his left paw ,,0,0,,A cautious reaction to the dog rather than that of perhaps concern. He doesnt leave the handlers side but I wouldnt say this is due to disinterest. He kept his eyes fixed on the dog passing by and looked over to handler twice for reassurance. ,,1,2,3,1,1,,,1,1,2,,Yes,,Handler mentions that urination is from stress although from the sniffing around the blanket I wouldn't want to rule out that this was perhaps not stress related,,2,1,3,,1,,,3,3,3,1,1,No,,Spent half the time at the gate and the other half exploring and sniffing,4,Considering Earls quite withdrawn natural demeanour I would call his response activated for him personally even though not necessarily for another dog. I also considered that when they went walking he was so excited to have her back that he made a small vocal wince at being back with her and even mouthed at her hand. ,,3,,,,,,,,,,,

However, he is still very fixated on his handler and even tries to mouth her hand a few times for attention. ",,4,,,2,"When he finally sat he maintained his position, but it took a number of attempts to get him into that seated position to begin with. ",,1,4,,"It took several attempts to get him to go into a down position. He initially moved from seated to standing rather than down, and then moved off the platform. The handler eventually attempts it off the platform and needs a few more goes. When Earl does adopt the down position he maintains it but I wonder if he would if handler were to stand up rather than remain crouched. He did seem settled though in his posture with hand quarters tilted to the side",,3,3,No,No,,3 attempts with food lure to get onto the table but jumped up otherwise unassisted. Assumed seated position for the first half of the body check but stood when asked for the second half. Seemed quite head shy and wasnt too fond of having his muzzle eyes and ears checked but seemed fine with the other checks. ,,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,,While I have remarked indifferent this is only because he makes no movements or attempts to get the towel off. His demeanor however subtle though is not neutral as his activity gets inhibited - ie his tail stops wagging. ,,1,2,3,3,3,2.0,3.0,3.0,1,,2,,,,2,More interested I would say this time than last. Did break the sit once but otherwise quite behaved and turned head away twice,,Left,3,1,2,,,After Marinara had confirmed this time that Earl was using his left paw I feel confident that me seeing him using his left paw in the first video is confirmed. ,,1,0,,,,1,1,3,1,1,,,1,1,2,,No,,No urinating but doesnt seem to be a blanket in the crate this time,,1,1,3,,1,,,4,1,1,1,1,No,,,4,Definitely happier to be with handler. ,,4,Slight look over as source but didnt react much at all or really investigate too much. Would have chosen a  more indifferent reaction to this if it were more available. ,,,,,,,,,,

Pulling less severe and panting toned down - no more wheezing - after defecation. ",,3,Didnt use platform.

Dog reverses off the platform and a few times after when the handler tries to get a sit. Once sitting Ebbi maintains.  ,,1,1,,"Very hesitant to assume down position, eventually goes down but breaks shortly after and then refuses to go down again thereafter.
