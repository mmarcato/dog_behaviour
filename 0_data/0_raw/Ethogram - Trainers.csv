But from her fixation on the kong, and un-diverted attention (apart from one gaze away) she was clearly very interested in it.

However, tail began wagging and was a lot happier to be back on lead rather than let off on his own - demeanor improved",,2 - Somewhat distracted,1 - not observed,"1 - lead relaxed, dog not straining against the lead",3 - Dog walks behind the handler,"Dog very obsessed with handler, when he comes over his initial sniffing and excitement at the environment, he locks attention is drawn to handler support. Even at one time trying to mouth at handlers hand and get attention and play. I would say this is probably a coping mechanism at being unsure over his environment",,3 - Good (2 attempts),"Standing Response:
First response he stepped off the platform - handler corrected the position. Thereafter a good and uninterrupted response. ",,4 - Excellent (1 attempt),Did sitting response first - when handler brought him onto the platform he immediately assume seated position so the assessors allowed him to first show this response. The sit was not asked so the response was not necessarily as was requested but Earl did keep his position and not move for the duration of the sit,,3 - Good (2 attempts),"4 - very settled,almost asleep",,Handler did struggle to get the dog into the down position but once in the position the response was excellent. I have scored good as per the difficulty in trying to get the dog into the position initially. The response thereafter was excellent. ,,1 - Refuse,3 - Cooperative,No,No,,"Early refused to get onto the table, not even wanted to put his fore-paws up and even after food lure and after handler climbs onto table herself in order to encourage.

Immediate change in posture - tail and ears lowered, back posture heightened and turned head toward handler and away from assessor holding him ",,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,,He seemed indifferent but from his body language he was more shutting down with the tea towel rather than being indifferent and hence I have stated indifferent and also change from neutral. Tail stopped wagging and becomes quite inhibited,,1,2,4,1,3,2,2,3,1 - not observed (0),,2 - is indifferent,,,,2 - Somewhat interested,"Kept seated, didnt shuffle, looks away for a time, and though he seems fixated I think he is more waiting on handler to make next move rather than having and very high interest over the kong",,Left,3 - Interacts with kong continuously,1 - Stays close to assessor,1 - Not bothered to let it go,,,Difficult to denote lateralisation with surety. However from the left tilt as he lay down and his head facing toward his left I would say he favoured his left paw ,,"0 - Cautious, seeks handler support",0 - does not leave trainer's side/comes back without being called,,A cautious reaction to the dog rather than that of perhaps concern. He doesnt leave the handlers side but I wouldnt say this is due to disinterest. He kept his eyes fixed on the dog passing by and looked over to handler twice for reassurance. ,,1 - without any encouragement,2 - Rarely,3 - Occasionally,1 - Never,1 - Never,,,1 - Never,1 - Never,"2 - Mildly stressed, good self-modulation",,Yes,,Handler mentions that urination is from stress although from the sniffing around the blanket I wouldn't want to rule out that this was perhaps not stress related,,2 - moderately playful,1 - Never,"3 - slightly excited, tail wagging",,1 - indifferent,,,3 - Occasionally,3 - Occasionally,3 - Occasionally,1 - Never,1 - Never,No,,Spent half the time at the gate and the other half exploring and sniffing,4 - activated approach,Considering Earls quite withdrawn natural demeanour I would call his response activated for him personally even though not necessarily for another dog. I also considered that when they went walking he was so excited to have her back that he made a small vocal wince at being back with her and even mouthed at her hand. ,,,"3 - minor reaction, but recovers",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, he is still very fixated on his handler and even tries to mouth her hand a few times for attention. ",,4 - Excellent (1 attempts),,,2 - Not great (3-4 attempts),"When he finally sat he maintained his position, but it took a number of attempts to get him into that seated position to begin with. ",,1 - Poor (5+ attempts),"4 - very settled,almost asleep",,"It took several attempts to get him to go into a down position. He initially moved from seated to standing rather than down, and then moved off the platform. The handler eventually attempts it off the platform and needs a few more goes. When Earl does adopt the down position he maintains it but I wonder if he would if handler were to stand up rather than remain crouched. He did seem settled though in his posture with hand quarters tilted to the side",,3 - Cooperative,3 - Cooperative,No,No,,3 attempts with food lure to get onto the table but jumped up otherwise unassisted. Assumed seated position for the first half of the body check but stood when asked for the second half. Seemed quite head shy and wasnt too fond of having his muzzle eyes and ears checked but seemed fine with the other checks. ,,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,,While I have remarked indifferent this is only because he makes no movements or attempts to get the towel off. His demeanor however subtle though is not neutral as his activity gets inhibited - ie his tail stops wagging. ,,1,2,3,3,3,2,3,3,1 - not observed (0),,2 - is indifferent,,,,2 - Mostly interested,More interested I would say this time than last.
